Initialised node and modules
> npm init -y
> npm install react react-dom

Not we can simply run "npm install" whith the package.json to get all the necessary
node modules

Then we installed more necessary modules:
> npm install @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react babel-loader

Beginning implementation of the "Experience_cards"
- I think the maximised cards would be good if they were "react-boostrap/Form"
- And then minimised cards would be nice if they were "react-boostrap/Card"

- Created Experience_cards_max.js
- imported a default card, along with import statements
- installed "react-boostrap"
    > npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
